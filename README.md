Welcome to the GitHub Page repo for all the code published for my *CSCI 5622: Machine Learning* website project (Spring 2023).
This repo is being used to provide all the raw code (examples) for the data prep, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML models, as well as detailed (mathematical) explanations (utilizing LaTeX in markdown) for specific ML models.
