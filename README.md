# CSCI 5622: Machine Learning Course Project (ML & Climate Change)
Welcome to the GitHub Page repo for all the code published for my *CSCI 5622: Machine Learning* website project (Spring 2023).
This repo is being used to provide all the raw code (examples) for the data prep, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML models, as well as detailed (mathematical) explanations (utilizing LaTeX in markdown) for specific ML models.

# Code and Data
The function of this repo is to demonstrate reproducibility of the coding done for this project; however, it's not to serve as an external source of data. In other words, there are no data files published to this repo but all data should be reproducible by cloning the code for this repo, obtaining the initial raw data from the initial data source, and then running all relevant code. 
(Data acquisition of API data requires to utilize your own API key/token(s), see the code comments for more info)
